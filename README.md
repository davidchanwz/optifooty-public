## Motivation

Football. The beautiful game. Being brought up in an era where legends like Gerrard, Drogba, Ozil, and the like dominated the footballing world, both of us developed a love for the Premier League.

Lately, football has become more and more analytical. The best teams in the world leverage data to optimize team and player performance, and make tactical profiles to discover hidden talent.

As Business Analytics students with a keen interest in data and football, we decided to embark on a journey to optimize Fantasy Premier League, a popular game where people compete to build the best squad possible reflecting real-world player performances.

We want to challenge ourselves and pick up useful skills in the process, learning Web Development to integrate analytics models that we’ve both come across in our courses and those beyond their scope - to become holistic analysts that can not only dig deep to discover insights from data but also make it presentable and accessible for audiences.

## Vision

At OptiFooty, our vision is to transform the Fantasy Premier League (FPL) experience by providing a comprehensive, user-friendly platform powered by advanced technology and data-driven insights. We aim to empower FPL managers to make informed decisions, optimize their teams, and enhance their enjoyment of the game.

We plan to use advanced algorithms and statistical analysis to offer accurate and actionable insights, ensuring users have the latest information. Our intuitive interface makes managing FPL teams seamless and enjoyable, with continuous improvements based on user feedback.

OptiFooty hopes to provide a range of tools, including team optimization, transfer suggestions, and in-depth player stats, catering to both novice and experienced FPL managers. We foster a community of FPL enthusiasts, encouraging collaboration and healthy competition.
